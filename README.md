# Wandering-Man-Windows

Here is a simple android game developed in Unity 3D 2018.2. In this game a first person character is designed to walk around and explore the environment. When the character collides with an object in the scene, the game not only displays the total number of collisions that have occurred so far, but it also detects and announces the type of object with which the character has collided. The game includes two different scenes in which user is able to switch to another one by voice command of "change".

The key features of the project is listed bellow.<br />
1- The unity's Occollusion Culling system has been employed to optimize the runtime rendering process.<br />
2- The unity's API for windows speach recognition is utilizd to detect the voice command.<br />
3- OnTriggerEnter() function is used to be in charge of detecting collisions.<br />
4- For creating the first person character, the FPS controller from unity's standard assets has been used.<br />
5- The FPS character has been modified to enable running by holding both "shift" keys on the keyboard. (In its default form the chracter runs just by holding right shift key.) <br />
6- As it is designed in FPS, arrow keys(and also the "A", "S", "D", "W" keys) can be used for moving, "Space" key for jumping and the mouse should be used to control the chracter's view and direction. <br />
7- Sounds effects are added to the scenes in order to make them more realistic.<br />
